### Product description

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of Light and are subject to change without notice.

While Products on Light are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on Light through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

### Purchasing process

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

- Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
- After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

### Order submission

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

- The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
- In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
- Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.
  All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

### Prices

Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

### Methods of payment

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Light.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, Light does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.

If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.

### Retention of usage rights

Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible.

#### Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions

Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.

The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.

Termination

Subscriptions may be terminated by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Light.
